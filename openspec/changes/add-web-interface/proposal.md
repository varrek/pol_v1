## Why

Users need a web-based interface to interact with the voting system without writing code, enabling easy poll creation, voting, and result viewing through a browser.

## What Changes

- Add HTML/CSS web interface for the voting system
- Add interactive poll creation form
- Add voting interface with real-time result display
- Add poll management UI (view, close, delete)
- Connect frontend to voting system backend

## Impact

- Affected specs: `web-ui` (new capability)
- Affected code: New web interface files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Dependencies: Requires `voting` capability (from add-voting-system change)
