## Why

The project needs version control to track changes, enable collaboration, and maintain a deployment-ready repository named "pols_v1".

## What Changes

- Initialize git repository
- Create comprehensive .gitignore for Node.js project
- Add initial commit with all project files
- Set up remote repository (pols_v1)
- Push code to remote

## Impact

- Affected specs: `version-control` (new capability)
- Affected code: Git configuration, .gitignore file
- Dependencies: Requires git installed and GitHub/GitLab account access
